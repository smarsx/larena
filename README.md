## Note

This document is not a complete or exhaustive source. At this moment the best source of information is the contracts themselves. Most of the logic is in Ocmeme.sol.

## Epoch

- a continuous loop of 30-day epochs create the game loop
- once an epoch has concluded, votes are tallied, winners are crowned, and minting/submitting/voting is opened for the next epoch

## Tokens

### Ocmeme

- ERC-721 priced on logistic [VRGDA](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda#logistic-issuance-schedule) curve
- 500 available per epoch, decreasing with each epoch.
- minted with ether
- given an emission multiple for continuous lazy $GOO emission (see $GOO)
- when epoch concludes, metadata is inherited from top-voted submission

### Pages

- ERC-721 priced on linear [VRGDA](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda#linear) curve
- minted with $GOO
- can only be used for a single submission
- stores metadata: royalty & sstore2 pointer to onchain data-uri

### Goo

- ERC-20 using [Gradual Ownership Optimization](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/goo)
- $GOO is lazily emitted by Ocmeme's based on their emission multiple
- use $GOO to vote on and mint $PAGES

## Actions
* code shown below is not identical to deployed code

### Mint

```solidity
function mint() external payable {
    (uint256 epochID, uint256 estart) = currentEpoch();
    uint256 price = _getPrice(estart, count);
    if (msg.value < price) revert InsufficientFunds();

    $epochs[epochID].proceeds += price;

    _mint(msg.sender, ++$prevTokenID, epochID, ++count);

    // refund overpaid
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, msg.value - price);
}
```

- the main entry point to ocmeme's
- minting an Ocmeme gives you a constant emission of $GOO, which is then used to mint and vote on $PAGES
- when epoch concludes tokenURI becomes top-voted page
- any funds paid > price are auto-refunded
- minting is open until epochs logistic asymptote (max_supply) is hit

### Submission

```solidity
function submit(
    uint256 _pageID,
    uint256 _royalty,
    NFTMeta.TypeURI _typeUri,
    string calldata _description,
    string calldata _duri
) external {
    ...
    address pointer = SSTORE2.write(
        NFTMeta.constructTokenURI(...)
    );
    $pages.setMetadata(_pageID, _royalty, pointer);
    $submissions[currentEpoch].push(_pageID);
    ...
}
```

- an unused $PAGES token is required to make a submission
- max 100 submissions per epoch
- top 3 submissions ranked by votes are crowned winners at conclusion of epoch
- Ocmeme tokenURI & royalty are inherited from top-voted submission

- _duri: any valid [data-uri](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs)
- _typeURI (image or animation) - used to decide data key in tokenURI json. {name: "", description: "", **image**: ""} vs {name: "", description: "", **animation_url**: ""}

### Vote

- use $GOO to vote on $PAGES
- voting burns $GOO used
- to avoid gas in the vote function, there are few safeguards, voting for an invalid pageID is allowed
- in the hours preceeding end of epoch, there is a penalty applied to votes.

### Claim

- once epoch is concluded the owners of top-voted $PAGES can claim their winnings.
- Gold: 85%
- Silver: 8%
- Bronze: 4%
- Protocol: 3%
